# ssh_automation
This will auto copy the SSH key towards the target machine, disabling the password prompt 
please make sure to change the permssion to +x eg. chmod +x $PATH/push_pass
then you can already use this script

NOTE: Please be mindfull of this command as this will cause a security flaw if you have copied your 
ssh/rsa key towards an unknown linux machine.
